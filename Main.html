        <p>Creating a games is a very difficult process, a lot goes into not only planning but managing where things are, the art, sound design,</p>
        <p>and writing the actual code. I have been creating games for while now and my own process to how I make games I would like to share</p>
        <h3><u>Here is a list of that process</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start of with an idea</li>
            <li>Find resources related</li>
            <li>Figure out how it's going to look(3D/2D art direction)</li>
            <li>Start scripting and organizing</li>
            <li>Audio Design</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><u>Start of with an idea</u></h2>
        <p>What do you want your game to be about? rpg, roguelike, shooter, bullet-hell,even better would be a combination of these things</p>
        <p>But you first goal should trying to created something you think would be fun, look to other good games as inspiration</p>

        <h2><u>Find resources related</u></h2>
        <p>Finding the resources to learn how to make your games is very important especially if you have never made the game before.</p>
        <p>This is also applies if you don't have much knowledge on the code your working with, for that look at</p>
        <a href="Table_of_Resources.html">Resource Links</a>
        <h2><u>Figure out how it's going to look(3D/2D art direction)</u></h2>
        <p>The look of a game I would say is the most important part of the game. The look is able to draw in players before they even see the game.</p>

        <p>If you're doing 3D look into how to make a character and proportions of them. Make the designs unique and pleasing to look at</p>
        <p>if you doing pixel art look into sprite sheets and color palettes to make your game look good in the style you want</p>
        <h2><u>Start scripting and organizing</u></h2>
        <p>You can now start scripting the mechanics of the game. always make folders for important game mechanics like movement,</p>
        <p>enemy behaviors, animation handlers and more, for resources on how to learn to use the engine there one is resource link</p>
        <p>that can be used for unity</p>
        <h2><u>Audio Design</u></h2>
        <p>Audio is one of the most underrated features in video games good audio can enhance how a game feels by a lot but bad audio design</p>
        <p>can suck the life out of the game and make it feel dull. when doing audio design focus on the context of what the audio is for</p>
        <p>for example if you hit metal i should sound like you hit a pan or anything metallic</p>
        <h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
        <p>This is the way I go about making games; however you are never limited to only following one process. maybe you want to finish the visuals</p>
        <p>for a game first then implement the mechanics that is perfectly fine, as long as you are following a good plan you should be able to succeed</p>
